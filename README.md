Voice Assistant
This project aims to develop a voice-controlled assistant that can recognize and respond to user commands.

The Voice Assistant project is designed using voice recognition and natural language processing to create an interactive assistant. The project relies on the following key libraries:

numpy: A powerful library for numerical computations in Python, which can be used for various mathematical operations and data manipulation tasks.
transformers: A library built on the popular Transformer architecture, providing pre-trained models and utilities for natural language processing tasks such as text classification, language translation, and question answering.
pyttsx3: A cross-platform text-to-speech library that enables the voice assistant to convert text into audible speech.
speech_recognition: A library that allows the voice assistant to recognize and transcribe spoken language into text.
By integrating these libraries, the voice assistant project can understand spoken commands, process the text, and generate appropriate responses using text-to-speech synthesis.
